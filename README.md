# 🏆 AI-Powered Tech Job Resume Matcher

### 🚀 Match your resume to the best tech jobs using AI & NLP!

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** to **match tech-related resumes to the most relevant job descriptions** and provide AI-generated suggestions for improvement.

---

## 📌 Features
✔️ **Tech Job Matching** → Uses NLP-based embeddings to find the best-matching **tech job** for a given resume.  
✔️ **AI-Powered Resume Analysis** → Analyzes your resume.  
✔️ **Runs on Google Colab** → No setup needed—just open the Colab notebook and run!  
✔️ **Uses Google Drive** → Model & datasets are stored in **Google Drive** for easy access.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Resume Embeddings** → Converts resumes into numerical representations using **Sentence Transformers**.
2. **Job Embeddings** → Converts tech job descriptions into embeddings.
3. **Matching Algorithm** → Uses **cosine similarity** to find the closest matching job description.

## 🚀 Running on Google Colab
### **1️⃣ Upload Required Files to Google Drive**

## 📁 File Structure (Google Drive + Google Colab)
Ensure your files are **uploaded to Google Drive** in the following structure:

- **My Drive/**
  - **trained_resume_model/** (Trained model directory)
    - `config.json`
    - `tokenizer.json`
    - `model.safetensors`
  - `resumes.csv` (Resume dataset)
  - `job_descriptions.csv` (Job descriptions dataset)
  - `app.ipynb` (Google Colab notebook)

---

## 📁 GitHub Repository Structure
Your **GitHub repository** should be structured as follows:

- **resume-matching-LLM/**
  - `train_model.ipynb` (Notebook for training the model)
  - `app.ipynb` (Google Colab notebook for running the app)
  - `README.md` (Project documentation)
  - `requirements.txt` (Dependencies for Colab)
  - `.gitignore` (Ignore unnecessary files)

---

### **2️⃣ Open & Run the Colab Notebook**
1. **Open Google Colab** → [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload **`app.ipynb`** to Colab.
3. **Mount Google Drive** when prompted.
4. Run all cells in the notebook.
5. A **Gradio web app** will launch with a public link where you can **paste a resume and get job matching results**.

---

## 📊 Model Training
### **🔹 How I Trained It**
- **Dataset**: Used a dataset of **tech resumes and job descriptions**.
- **Embeddings Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for **resume-job similarity**.
- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned `t5-small` to generate **resume feedback**.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
🚀 **Expand to Other Job Sectors** (Right now, it’s focused on tech jobs).  
🚀 **Improve Resume Feedback** by fine-tuning a more powerful LLM.  
🚀 **Deploy on Hugging Face for Public Access** (Currently runs only on Google Colab).
